## About The Project



In 2019, my relative passed away from cardiac arrest. The sudden loss left me with a feeling of emptiness that couldn't be filled with pictures or videos.

Which brought me to this project:
* I realized what I missed most was his witty bantor and his nagging
* This lead me to believe that actually speaking to something "like" him would have helped me process my grief at his passing
